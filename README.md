## About

Are you a technical diver looking to expand your network and dives?

DiversConnect is here to help.

### What 
Divers can find each other, meet up for dives, create profiles to list their dives and credentials, sell their gear, and get the latest updates within the community. 

### Why

Currently, there is no app for divers to find each other and post about their dives. The Diving community is mostly word-of-mouth, dependant on third-party businesses for group dives, and largely, small.

### Who

DiversConnect is for all types of Divers. From beginners, to experts.
